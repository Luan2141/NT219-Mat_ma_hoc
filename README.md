Lab 1 : Measuring encryption and decryption time of AES and DES encryption algorithms on Windows and Linux operating systems.
Lab 2 : Code AES - CBC mode using C++.
Lab 3 : Code RSA, then measure the execution time of each function with corresponding test cases on Windows and Linux operating systems.
Lab 4 : Code an ECC-based Digital signature program with CryptoPP/Openssl and measure the execution time of each function with corresponding test cases on Windows and Linux operating systems.
Lab 5 : Code a program to hash SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512, SHAKE128,SHAKE256 and then measure the execution time of each function with corresponding test cases on Windows and Linux operating systems.
Lab 6 : MD5 collision attacks
